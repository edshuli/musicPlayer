### About
<hr>

*This website was created as part of my course at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/?utm_source=bing-brand&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=BG-Brand-Udemy_la.EN_cc.ROW&utm_term=_._ag_1219358808134939_._ad__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_kwd-76210237821084_._li_2484_._pd__._&utm_term=_._pd__._kw_udemy%2B_._&matchtype=e&msclkid=a8cb22e88b6e14c02a4b7d3f06cd0006">Udemy JavaScript Course</a>.*

*The purpose of it, is to understand how music works on computer, I was always interested in it so now I got to make one by myself.*

The site contains the following:

* Some album artwork.
* The title of the song and the artist.
* The cuurent time.
* The whole duration of the song.
* And the prev, next and play button.

* We can also loop throught the songs indefinitely.

*The technologies we used to create the website are the follow:*
